        <h3>Our Aim</h3>
        <p>We plan to provide basic mental health support by Counselling and teaching some Yogic processes. We will train
            willing people to help the staff at hospitals and vaccination centers, to take up queries, calls, arranging
            stuff, and other menial jobs. Also, some facilities for cremations of bodies can be done, We can also create
            awareness for people to take care of the distressing situations at covid affected homes.And also we wish to
            spread our branches all over the country. </p>
