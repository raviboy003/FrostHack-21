            <p>A key strategy for managing COVID-19 is mitigating community transmission via awareness and preventive
                methods, for which it is critical to strengthen frontline worker (FLW) preparedness. This is particularly
                necessary for dealing with this health emergency to reach out to populations in remote and rural parts of
                India. Literature on the management of previous communicable-disease outbreaks indicates that FLWsâ€™
                embeddedness in the community can support the health system in generating awareness, implementing prevention
                strategies, and support with contact tracing and isolation of potential cases.
